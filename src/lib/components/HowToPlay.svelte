  <p class="font-black text-2xl">Predict the first round of the NHl draft</p>
  <ul class=" text-lg">
    <li>- Draft your own first round</li>
    <li>- Drafting will close 12 hours before the official NHL draft</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="font-black text-2xl">How points work</p>
  <ul class=" text-lg">
    <li>- Every pick starts with 10 points.</li>
    <li>- After a prospect is chosen in the official draft, 1 point will be deducted for every spot the pick differs from the actual draft position, whether it's higher or lower. </li>
  </ul>
